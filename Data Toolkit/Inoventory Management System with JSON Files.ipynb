    "this is a great practical project that will consolidate your knowledge of File I/O, data structure, and potentially OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overview: The system will manage a list of products, their quantities, and potentially other details (price, etc).\n",
    "- Product Details: Each product can be represented as a dictionary : {\"name\": \"Product A\" , \"quantity\" : 10 , \"price\" : 25.00}\n",
    "- Updating Inventory: Reading the inventory from a file, modifying the quantities, and writing the updated inventory back to the file.\n",
    "- Adding Functionalities : Implementing features like adding new products, removing products, generating reports, etc.\n",
    "- Generating Sales: Recording sales transactions and updating the inventory accordingly.\n",

    "Using JSON : JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common format for storing structured data.\n",
    "python's json module makes it easy to work with JSON data."
